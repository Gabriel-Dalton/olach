Olach is designed with sustainability in mind, achieving a carbon rating of **A** on Website Carbon. This means it’s cleaner than **87% of all tested web pages globally**, producing just **0.13g of CO2** per visit, aligning with our goal to minimize environmental impact.

## Name Origin:
The name **Olach** is derived from the Irish word **"i bhfolach,"** meaning "hidden." This name reflects the app’s core mission of keeping your notes private and secure, ensuring your data is only accessible by you.

## Future Development:
I aim to continue working on adding **AES encryption** using CryptoJS to ensure advanced security for your notes. Other planned features include **auto-locking** after inactivity, **password protection** for added privacy, and offering the choice between **local storage** or using external options like **cookies**, **Supabase**, or **Firebase** if users prefer to store their data on a server.
